  This webring is focused on <strong>people</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Because of this, it is not interested in listing accessibility companies and professional organizations. If that is something you are looking for, check <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/#professional-help">this list of professional help</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This webring also forbids participation from <a href="https://overlayfactsheet.com/">overlay companies</a>, as well as employees of overlay companies. This is due to overlaysâ€™ exploitative, unethical behavior and damaging impact on digital accessibility efforts.
